# ERC20 Tokens Payment Channel

In this course, we will build a payment channel that allows an ecommerce website accept cryptocurrency payments via ERC20 Tokens e.g Compound Token (COMP), Binance Token (BNB) among others.

You will be introduced to Solidity, a programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. You will also learn about tools and technologies such as Etherjs, Remix & Metamask, used to build decentralised apps.

By the end of this course, you would have:

- Built your first decentralised application.
- Deployed an ERC20 Token on the Ethereum Test Network.
- Gained a good basic grasp on building Dapps
- A project to showcase
- Achieved more than what most people who have been trying to learn on their own for months have not achieved.
